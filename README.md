# twitter_SNA

## Description
This repo is for the code and other materials I develop for my MSc dissertation project. The project takes the form of an internship with the company Barrachd and focuses on identifying influential actors in Twitter networks. It is particularly interested in networks which have spiked in popularity and identifying the accounts which drove that.

## Files
Main_prototype.py is the first attempt at analysing Twitter networks automatically.

Main_prototype_twibot.py is main_prototype wrapped in a twitter bot - you tweet it a topic and it replies with the most influential users and a network map

Bluetick.py is a test file for finding users with a 'blue tick' which means they are verified and counted as publuic figures
