# twitter_SNA

## Description
This repo is for the code and other materials I develop for my MSc dissertation project. The project takes the form of an internship with the company Barrachd and focuses on identifying influential actors in Twitter networks. It is particularly interested in networks which have spiked in popularity and identifying the accounts which drove that.
